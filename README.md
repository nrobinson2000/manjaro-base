![](screenshot.png)

**A script and collection of files to replicate my personal [Manjaro Cinnamon](https://www.manjaro.org/downloads/community/cinnamon/) setup.**

## Installation

After installing Manjaro Cinnamon, open a terminal and enter the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nrobinson2000/manjaro-base
cd manjaro-base
./setup.sh
```

For the changes to take full effect, log out of cinnamon and then log back in.
